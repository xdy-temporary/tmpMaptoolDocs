### \[ \] Display Tooltip to GM Option

<div>

• **Introduced in version 1.3.b58**

</div>

**\[gt: \]**, **\[gmtt: \]** evaluates the text after the ':' and will
display the result to everyone, but only displays the tooltip to the GM.
For example,  will, depending on the GM's preferences, show
«<font color="blue"> 2+2 = 2 + 2 = 4 </font>» to the GM in his chat
window, or when he hovers his mouse over the output, but would only show
the result of the calculation, in this case 4, to everyone else,
including yourself.

This roll option may be combined with the , , , and  options. Blank
messages will not be shown to a certain user if an entire message is
invisible to that user due to these roll options or the  roll option.
