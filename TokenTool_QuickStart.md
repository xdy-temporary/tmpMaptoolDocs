This is the Quick Start Guide to using TokenTool v2.1. The premiere
token creation tool for Virtual TableTop programs

You can get TokenTool 2.1
[here](https://www.rptools.net/toolbox/token-tool/).

## User Interface

  - Canvas Panel
    In the Canvas panel of the UI you position and size your desired
    image in relation to the Token Ring or Overlay with your mouse.
    Left-click and drag to position. Use mouse-wheel to size image.
  - Token Preview
    In the upper right you can see what the resulting token image will
    look like when you save it.
  - Overlay Selection
    In the lower right you can choose your Token Overlay from the list
    of different types and styles. The pixel dimensions of the selected
    Overlay are displayed below the name.
  - Token Size
    The image size of the resulting token is shown in the bottom right.
    You should set the token size to be the same or smaller than that of
    the selected Overlay.

If you want to follow along with the next steps, go ahead and click on
Overlay Option then locate a token overlay that you want to use. Once
you select it, the overlay will appear on the Canvas.

## Creating a Token

Say I need to create a token for an Orc warrior princess. In my web
browser I go to [Google Image Search](https://images.google.com) and
enter *orc warrior princess* as my search terms. I like the 3rd one that
comes up by [Oksana
Diada](https://oksanadiada.artstation.com/projects/vda2O). I click on
the entry in the search list and then right-click on the image to *Copy
Image*. Back in TokenTool, I hit Ctrl-V (or use the Edit menu) to paste
my orc princess into the Canvas. You can also drag-n-drop an image from
your computer onto the Canvas area.

The image I have chosen is quite large but that's okay. Using the
mouse-wheel I can quickly resize it to fit within the token overlay I've
chosen. I get something like this:

## Saving a Token

With my token complete, I need only left-click on the Token Preview to
drag the token image from the Token Preview area to my computer or
directly into MapTool. I can also save it from the File menu to my
computer.

My Orc Warrior Princess is ready\!
