{{MacroFunction |name=abort |version=1.3b42 |description=

Is used to conditionally abort the execution of a macro. If the argument
to  is 0 then the execution of the macro stops and all macro output is
discarded. If the argument to  is non zero then the macro continues.

Note that only the output of the macro is discarded when the macro is
aborted any changes made to macros will not be undone.

Common uses for this function are

  - Ending a macro if the cancel button is clicked on an input dialog
    created using the [input()](Macros:Functions:input "wikilink")
    function.
  - Discarding all output generated by the macro, in effect making a
    "silent" macro.
  - Silently bailing out of a macro if a certain condition is not met.

If you prefer to display an error message when exiting the macro see the
\[\[assert|
