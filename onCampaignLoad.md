## onCampaignLoad Macro

**â€¢ Introduced in version 1.3b51**

A special macro that can be created on [library
tokens](Library_Token "wikilink") to have macro code automatically
execute when a campaign is loaded. A campaign is considered to have been
loaded if it is opened via the File menu, or upon connecting to a server
running that campaign. All output from an  macro is discarded, when it
is executed automatically.

This special macro is ideally suited for loading your User Defined
Functions (UDFs) via [defineFunction()](defineFunction "wikilink").

When an onCampaignLoad macro is executed automatically, it is considered
a [Trusted Macro](Trusted_Macro "wikilink"). If you wish to use trusted
functions within  and execute it manually (e.g. while developing
macros), you will have to make sure that it follows all of the rules of
[Trusted Macros](Trusted_Macro "wikilink").

### How to Create an onCampaignLoad Macro

You can create an  macro on any [library
token](Library_Token "wikilink"); simply create a macro that is
specifically named .

### Limitations

  - Do not make changes within the  macro to the library token it
    resides upon. This is not supported by MapTool. A duplicate lib
    token can/will appear and this will/can break stuff.
  - Some macro functions may not work as expected if run in  without
    deferring their execution by using the defer option of
    [execLink()](execLink "wikilink").
      - [goto()](goto "wikilink"), [setZoom()](setZoom "wikilink") and
        similar function calls should be placed in a separate macro to
        be called via [execLink()](execLink "wikilink")

### Example of Deferred Function Calls

Inside the  macro place code like this:

``` mtmacro numberLines
[h: link = macroLinkText("deferredCalls@"+getMacroLocation())]
[h: execLink(link,1)]
```

And in the deferredCalls() macro place the functions to be deferred.

``` mtmacro numberLines
[h: goto("2")]
[h: setZoom(2)]
```
