## Image Token

An image token is a [Token](Token "wikilink") whose name starts with the
string "image:" -- case is not important. These
[tokens](Token "wikilink") can appear on any [map](Map:map "wikilink")
and you can use functions such as [getImage()](getImage "wikilink") to
search through all of the [maps](Map:map "wikilink") to find the
[token](Token "wikilink") and return the [asset id](Asset_ID "wikilink")
for the [token](Token "wikilink")'s image. The [image
token](Image_Token "wikilink") does not have to be owned by a player to
be used but the [visible to player](Token:visible_to_player "wikilink")
flag must be set. You can not have more than one [image
token](Image_Token "wikilink") with the same name in a [campaign
file](Campaign:campaign_file "wikilink").
