         Aura is a special light source because while it is blocked by
         VBL and can cast colored light, it does not actually illuminate
         anything. (An aura will not reveal hidden areas to a player,
         but it does act as a way to see how far from a token its aura
         extends).

         The aura group name is not included by default and must be
         added by the user.

         To add auras:

         | From within MapTool
         | Edit -> Campaign Properties -> Click the "Light" tab

         The following is an example of the Aura group as it might be
         entered.

         | ``Aura``
         | ``----``
         | ``Aura Med Red 5' threat : aura square 7.50#55333``
         | ``Aura Med malign 30' : aura square 32.50#330033``

         | In the first entry "Aura Med Red 5' threat" is a descriptor
           and has no effect upon the light.
         | The information after the colon defines the light.
         | "Aura" is the type of light.
         | "Square" defines the shape of the light.
         | "7.50" defines the range of the light.
         | The number preceded by "#" is an RGB value for the color of
           the light.
