Aura is a special light source because while it is blocked by VBL and
can cast colored light, it does not actually illuminate anything. (An
aura will not reveal hidden areas to a player, but it does act as a way
to see how far from a token its aura extends).

The aura group name is not included by default and must be added by the
user.

To add auras:

| From within MapTool
| Edit -> Campaign Properties -> Click the "Light" tab

The following is an example of the Aura group as it might be entered.
