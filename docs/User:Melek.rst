         This is a holding pen for my Documentation to-dos and their
         relevant documentation. It is also a place for me to test out
         formatting, etc.

         -  Phergus: @Melek One of the things we need to do is get more
            some documentation on features that have been added recently
            as well as some older ones that I don't believe are
            documented like the **Auto-Resize** for maps. More recent
            features include **Draw Explorer** which could use some
            examples of how you can use it to level up map making in
            MapTool. --**Melek**

            -  It would be pretty easy to adapt the old announcement
               (`[1] <https://www.rptools.net/2016/05/new-functionality-draw-explorer/>`__)
               about it to a new article. --**Melek**

            -  **Progress:** Added 'Auto-Resize' to the `Feature
               List <Feature_List>`__

         -  Jamz: FWIW, the for() roll option doesn't mention the use of
            , CODE: {} as an option like for each, put it on the
            list!Â :smile: (I was literally there 2 mins ago so see if
            code block worked because I was getting an error)

         -  PhilN04: @Melek Somebody was having an issue with switch and
            how it handles the default case a few weeks ago; it was
            either here or in the scripting channels. I'm not sure if
            anything was done about it in 1.5.4, but that may call for
            some documentation around it. --**Melek**

         -  Jamz: The wiki occasionally gets bot'd to death so there may
            be some nasty/bad articles in there. --**Melek**

         -  Jamz: there is the GitHub issues, and there is a tag for
            "documentation" --**Melek**

         -  Jamz: @Melek FYI We also create a repo a while ago to hold
            our docs, eventually...
            `[2] <https://github.com/RPTools/Documentation>`__

         -  Discord user xdy is doing some awesome work trying to
            convert the wiki to markdown/a github wiki with pandoc.
