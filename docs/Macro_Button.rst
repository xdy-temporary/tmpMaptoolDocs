                  Sample View of Macro Buttons

         Macro Buttons are user-clickable buttons that executes a macro
         with a single click (as opposed to having to type the entire
         macro to chat). When a macro is created, it automatically
         generates a labeled button (the label is the name given by the
         macro author to the macro).

         The screenshot below shows some example macro buttons. Note
         that buttons can have varying button and font colors, and can
         be sorted and arranged in various ways.

         When the macro button is clicked, the contents of the macro are
         populated to the Chat Panel and the commands are parsed and
         executed.
