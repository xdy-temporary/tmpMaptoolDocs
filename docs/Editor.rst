         This is the place for all things Editor.

         We don't currently have a full-fledged editing guidelines
         written up, so in the meantime you'll have to take a peek at
         how current articles are being editing. A good way to make sure
         you're looking at an article that has the current formatting is
         to look for recently edited function articles in the
         `Special:RecentChanges </rptools/wiki/Special:RecentChanges>`__
         and look at Rumble's newer Introduction Series

         We use templates rather extensively, so reading the
         `Help:Editing </rptools/wiki/Help:Editing>`__ article will help
         a lot with understanding the syntax of our custom templates.

         Although you might stumble across an article within a
         namespace, we currently place all articles in the main
         namespace(which is to say, no namespace), with the exception of
         this special Editor namespace. If you happen to come across one
         of those articles that is still within a namespace, it is most
         likely due to plans of splitting it, or perhaps rewriting it,
         don't worry about moving it.
