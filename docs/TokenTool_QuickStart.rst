         Canvas Panel
            In the Canvas panel of the UI you position and size your
            desired image in relation to the Token Ring or Overlay with
            your mouse. Left-click and drag to position. Use mouse-wheel
            to size image.
         Token Preview
            In the upper right you can see what the resulting token
            image will look like when you save it.
         Overlay Selection
            In the lower right you can choose your Token Overlay from
            the list of different types and styles. The pixel dimensions
            of the selected Overlay are displayed below the name.
         Token Size
            The image size of the resulting token is shown in the bottom
            right. You should set the token size to be the same or
            smaller than that of the selected Overlay.

         |TokenTool GUI|

         If you want to follow along with the next steps, go ahead and
         click on Overlay Option then locate a token overlay that you
         want to use. Once you select it, the overlay will appear on the
         Canvas.

         Say I need to create a token for an Orc warrior princess. In my
         web browser I go to `Google Image
         Search <https://images.google.com>`__ and enter *orc warrior
         princess* as my search terms. I like the 3rd one that comes up
         by `Oksana
         Diada <https://oksanadiada.artstation.com/projects/vda2O>`__. I
         click on the entry in the search list and then right-click on
         the image to *Copy Image*. Back in TokenTool, I hit Ctrl-V (or
         use the Edit menu) to paste my orc princess into the Canvas.
         You can also drag-n-drop an image from your computer onto the
         Canvas area.

         The image I have chosen is quite large but that's okay. Using
         the mouse-wheel I can quickly resize it to fit within the token
         overlay I've chosen. I get something like this:

            :name: saving-a-token

         With my token complete, I need only left-click on the Token
         Preview to drag the token image from the Token Preview area to
         my computer or directly into MapTool. I can also save it from
         the File menu to my computer.

         |Example Token|

         My Orc Warrior Princess is ready!

         This QuickStart Guide only touched upon the basics of using
         TokenTool. You should experiment with the various options
         available to get a feel for what else it can do.

         A TokenTool User Guide is being prepared to more fully describe
         the capabilities.
