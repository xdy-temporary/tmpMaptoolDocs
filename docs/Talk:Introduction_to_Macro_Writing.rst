         Should I just use the source highlighting feature for the
         macros in this guide? I'd like to clearly set them off from the
         rest of the text, which is why the blockquotes have the gray
         background - however, the blockquote method is a PAIN. I can
         put the source-tagged text inside a blockquote (to keep it
         inset). Should I switch to the source-tagged option, or should
         I leave it? `Rumble </rptools/wiki/User:Cclouser>`__ 03:44, 5

         -  We typically use the source tag whenever presenting macro
            code, and the pre tag when presenting multi-line output from
            those macros, but the pre tag won't really work with the way
            you're formatting the output to look as close to the real
            output as possible. If you find yourself writing complex
            markup a lot, it might also be better to make a template out
            of it. `zEal </rptools/wiki/User:Verisimilar>`__ 03:50, 5
