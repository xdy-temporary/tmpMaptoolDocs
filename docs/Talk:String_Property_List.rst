         so I am trying to set up a macro that will roll for skills in
         DND3.5 the current way i have it is with each skill value as a
         string property list with the keys mod(what attribute modifies
         the skill), rank( how many ranks the character has in the
         skill), and misc(for miscellaneous modifiers) I have an input
         that shows a list of all the skills and returns the one
         selected as a string... now I have questions... can i even use
         a string property list for the properties of a token? is there
         a special format? and how would I use the eval() roll option to
         add these scores, because the mod key contains a string which
         corresponds to another of the tokens properties... also if I'm
         placing this in the wrong place I'm sorry. I just don't know
         where to go.
