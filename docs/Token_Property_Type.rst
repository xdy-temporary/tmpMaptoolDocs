Token property type is the designation given for a particular `token
property <Token:token_property>`__ set that has been established for a
particular campaign. When used in a `macro
function <Macros:Functions:list_of_functions>`__, the type must be
enclosed in quotes.

By default, MapTool provides a token property set called *Basic*.
However, users may establish additional token property sets as they
desire by adding new types using the Campaign Properties dialog. The
*type* is the name given to the token property set.

For example, in the image below, there are three token property types
(visible in the left-hand column under *Token Type*): "Basic",
"Library", and "NPC":
