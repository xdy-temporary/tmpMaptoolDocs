   {{MacroFunction
   |name=execLink
   |version=1.3b55
   |trusted=true
   |description=
   Executes a macro link that was created with {{func|macroLinkText}}, output generated by the link is sent to players using the standard {{func|macroLinkText}} logic. {{func|execLink}} allows you to defer the running of the link until after the currently running macro has ended in which case the output will be displayed after any output generated by the current macro. If you defer a series of links, they will be queued in order and executed after the currently running macro. There is no software limit to the amount of links you can queue, but your hardware will impose its own limitations. If the execution of the link is not defered then any output generated will appear ''before'' any output generated by the current macro. 

   You can use this function to update values in a token copied with {{func|copyToken}} using the defered option. You can also use this function to send output selectivly to a list of players from the current macro, or to generate output that is not suppressed when the {{func|abort}} function is called.

   |usage=

   <source lang="mtmacro" line>
   execLink(link)
   </source>
   <source lang="mtmacro" line>
   execLink(link, defer)
   </source>
   '''Parameters'''
   {{param|link|The link to "execute".}}
   {{param|defer|Executes the link after the current macro has completed if non zero, defaults to zero.}}

   |examples=
   Execute a macro link immediatly (any output wil appear before the current macros output)
   <source lang="mtmacro" line>
   [h: link = macroLinkText("Test@Lib:Test", "self")]
   [h: execLink(link)]
   </source>

   Execute a macro link after the execution of the current macro (any output will appear before the current macros output)
   <source lang="mtmacro" line>
   [h: link = macroLinkText("Test@Lib:Test", "self")]
   [h: execLink(link, 1)]
   </source>

   Copy a token and update its values.
   <source lang="mtmacro" line>
   [h: newToken = copyToken("Hero")]
   [h: link = macroLinkText("update@Lib:GM", "none", "", newToken)]
   [h: execLink(link)]
   </source>
