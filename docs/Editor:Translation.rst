         Since this should be the first page that you translate, the
         following steps will use this page as an example. Every
         occurrence of ``Editor:Translation`` should be replaced with
         the name of the page you are translating. After you have
         completed the translation of this page, you should be
         comfortable translating any page on the wiki.

         #. Edit the existing page and add
            ``{{Languages|Editor:Translation}}`` at the very bottom, if
            it does not already exist. Remember that
            ``Editor:Translation`` should be changed to the name of the
            page you are translating.
         #. Copy the content of the English translation to your
            clipboard to use as a starting point for your translation.
         #. Save your changes to the English translation, if you made
            any. If you did not make any changes, simply cancel the
            edit.
         #. To begin your translation, you must enter the URL of the
            English translation into your browsers address bar, and then
            append ``/fr`` to the end. In our example, the final URL
            would be
            ``http://lmwcs.comEditor:Translation/fr`` .
            ``/fr`` in this case is the french language code, you can
            find your appropriate language code in the table at the
            bottom of this article.
         #. Your translated page should reasonably maintain the same
            format and layout as the existing English translation, where
            possible. There are a couple exceptions, however. The
            overall source of your translated article should look like
            this:

         ::

            {{Languages|Page Name}}{{Translation}}
            __TOC__
            YOUR TRANSLATED PAGE HERE
            {{Languages|Page Name}}

         .. rubric:: System Messages to Translate
            :name: system-messages-to-translate

         The use of ``@`` is to show where a variable element is used.
         Keep the numbering intact or there is a good possibility the
         messages will be shown in the wrong areas.
