         DeviantNull's Character Sheet framework is a commonly used
         framework that allows a "macro-less" combat system to be
         integrated into Maptools

         This guide assumes:

         -  You have maptools installed
         -  You have read the maptools tutorials
         -  You have DeviantNull's Character Sheet framework installed

         .. rubric:: Creating a character
            :name: creating-a-character

         -  Drag a token that you want to become a character on the map
         -  Double click on the token and go to the "Config" tab
         -  In the "Properties" section, select DNA

         This designates that token as a "Player" and should now have a
         character sheet
