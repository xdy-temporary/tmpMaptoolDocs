         Token Size refers to the standard sizes defined for each Grid
         Type. The sizes mostly apply to those tokens on the Token layer
         representing PCs and NPCs but can be used on any token no
         matter the layer.

         .. rubric:: Sizes and Scales
            :name: sizes-and-scales

         The Size is what is presented in the Size drop-down in the Edit
         Token dialog or the Size sub-menu of the right-click contextual
         menu of a token. Internally a scale factor is also applied and
         that factor is shown in the tables below.

         The valid sizes for each type of grid are documented below,
         where **Medium** is always 1 full grid cell. The **Scale** is a
         multiplier for the size of the image after configuring it to
         fit within the stated footprint. For example, the ``Huge`` size
         on a square grid occupies a 3x3 cell area and the image is
         scaled (**1.0**) to exactly fit that area. But the ``Large``
         size on a hex grid is 3 hexes scaled down 10% (**0.9**) so as
         to keep the image slightly within the border of the 3 cells. On
         Square Grids the sizes follow the D&D standard.

   | **Needs Clarification:**
   | It would be nice to include pictures that demonstrate how the grid
     cells are composed; at least for the hex grids.
