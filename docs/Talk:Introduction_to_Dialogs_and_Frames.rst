         The example at the very bottom for the advanced character sheet
         references the macro "CharSheetHeader" but doesn't actually
         outline what exactly goes into it, anywhere on the page.
         Presumably that's the bit that's holding the "Main" and
         "Weapons" links at the top of the screenshot, but something
         like this should probably be spelled out
         somewhere.--\ `Xazak </maptool/index.php?title=User:Xazak&action=edit&redlink=1>`__

         The last example in this tutorial seems incomplete - the
         CharSheet macro calls another macro called CharSheetHeader, but
         this macro doesn't seem to have been written (or I'm going
         blind, which is possible). Has anyone worked out how to do
         this? I'm new to using HTML so some advice would be helpful.

         Also, the campaign file at the bottom of the screen doesn't
         seem to load in MapTool.
