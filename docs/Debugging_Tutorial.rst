         .. rubric:: Debug Methods For Maptool Scripting
            :name: debug-methods-for-maptool-scripting

         *A tutorial to squash little critters from your MT code.*

         .. rubric:: What is this about?
            :name: what-is-this-about

         I've been working with MT for over 2 years now and I can still
         remember the initial struggle I had due to the lack of any
         debugger. As it turns out there are quite a few methods to
         debug your code but unfortunately they're not very obvious to
         find. So here is a short summary of available tools.

         I've marked this article as 'advanced' as it does assume that
         you know the basics of MT script, like `Library
         Token </rptools/wiki/Library_Token>`__,
         `onCampaignLoad </rptools/wiki/onCampaignLoad>`__ and `User
         defined functions </rptools/wiki/defineFunction>`__.

         .. rubric:: Notepad++
            :name: notepad

         The most basic form of debugging is using an editor that uses
         syntax highlights for your code. Np++ can help with that,
         especially in combination with
         `rpedit <http://forums.rptools.net/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=16770>`__
         created by Aliasmask. You can find the install for np++ and
         syntax highlighting (also by
         AM)\ `here <http://forums.rptools.net/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=13690>`__.
         Once you've done that go to: Settings -> Preferences -> New
         Document/Default Directory to automatically convert ANSI files
         to UTF-8 without BOM on open (so both the radiobutton and the
         checkbox). This helps when copy pasting code straight from a
         website into np, sometimes ansi character creep in there with
         which MT cannot work giving errors like 'unknown character
         0x0A'.

         .. rubric:: Pause
            :name: pause

         The most basic and I think most used method is the 'Pause'
         method as developed by zEal. The only way in MT to interrupt
         the flow of the code is with the use of
         `input() </rptools/wiki/input>`__. zEal created some clever
         code around `input() </rptools/wiki/input>`__ to use for
         debugging. His full contribution can be found here:
         `[1] <http://forums.rptools.net/viewtopic.php?p=110935#p110935>`__.
         Its working is simple as shown in this example:

         .. container:: mw-geshi mw-code mw-content-ltr

            .. container:: mtmacro source-mtmacro

               #. .. code-block:: none

                       [h:strength = 5]

               #. .. code-block:: none

                       [h:toughness = 10]

               #. .. code-block:: none

                       [h:pause("strength", "toughness")]

               #. .. code-block:: none

                       [r:"This text you'll see AFTER the pause"]

         The running code will stop after the toughness=10 line, show
         the two variables both name and value and after you've clicked
         ok the code will continue. It is possible to just run:

         .. container:: mw-geshi mw-code mw-content-ltr

            .. container:: mtmacro source-mtmacro

               #. .. code-block:: none

                      [h: pause()]

         in several places in your code so you can check where it
         crashes.

         In order for pause to work in your campaign you will need a
         library token with an
         `onCampaignLoad </rptools/wiki/onCampaignLoad>`__ macro
         containing the following line:

         .. container:: mw-geshi mw-code mw-content-ltr

            .. container:: mtmacro source-mtmacro

               #. .. code-block:: none

                       [ defineFunction("pause", "pause@this", 1, 0 ) ]

         and you will also need a macro called ``pause`` on the same
         library token containing the following code:

         .. container:: mw-geshi mw-code mw-content-ltr

            .. container:: mtmacro source-mtmacro

               #. .. code-block:: none

                         [ toolkit.DebugVariableCount = argCount() ]

               #. .. code-block:: none

                         [ toolkit.DebugInputParameter = ".|<html>" +

               #. .. code-block:: none

                             "<table cellspacing='2' cellpadding='0' style='background-color:#595751'>" +

               #. .. code-block:: none

                             "<tr><td>" +

               #. .. code:: de2

                             "<table width='300px' cellspacing='0' cellpadding='2' style='background-color:#FAF9F5;'>" +

               #. .. code-block:: none

                             "%{toolkit.DebugVariableRows}</table></td></tr></html>" +

               #. .. code-block:: none

                             "|Debugger|LABEL|SPAN=TRUE"

               #. .. code-block:: none

                         ]

               #. .. code-block:: none

                         [ toolkit.DebugVariableRow = "<trÂ %{toolkit.DebugVariableRowStyle}><td>" +

               #. .. code:: de2

                             "<b>%{toolkit.DebugVariableName}</b></td><td>%{toolkit.DebugVariableContent}" +

               #. .. code-block:: none

                         ]

               #. .. code-block:: none

                         [ toolkit.DebugVariableRows = "<tr style='background-color:#E0DDD5; font-size:1.1em;'><td><b>Variable</b></td><td><b>Value</b></td></tr>" ]

               #. .. code-block:: none

                         [ count( toolkit.DebugVariableCount ), code:

               #. .. code:: de2

                         {

               #. .. code-block:: none

                             [ toolkit.DebugVariableRowStyle = "" ]

               #. .. code-block:: none

                             [ toolkit.DebugVariableName = arg( roll.count ) ]

               #. .. code-block:: none

                             [ toolkit.DebugVariableContent = eval( arg( roll.count ) ) ]

               #. .. code-block:: none

                             [ if( floor( roll.count/2 ) == roll.count/2 ), code:

               #. .. code:: de2

                             {

               #. .. code-block:: none

                                 [ toolkit.DebugVariableRowStyle = "style='background-color:#EDECE8;'" ]

               #. .. code-block:: none

                             } ]

               #. .. code-block:: none

                             [ toolkit.DebugVariableRows = toolkit.DebugVariableRows +

               #. .. code-block:: none

                                 strformat( toolkit.DebugVariableRow )

               #. .. code:: de2

                             ]

               #. .. code-block:: none

                         } ]

               #. .. code-block:: none

                         [ if( toolkit.DebugVariableCount == 0 ), code:

               #. .. code-block:: none

                         {

               #. .. code-block:: none

                             [ toolkit.DebugVariableRows = "<tr><td style='font-size: 1.4em' align='center'><b>Pause</b></td></tr>" ]

               #. .. code:: de2

                         } ]

               #. .. code-block:: none

                     Â 

               #. .. code-block:: none

                         [ toolkit.DebugBreak = input( strformat( toolkit.DebugInputParameter ) )]

               #. .. code-block:: none

                         [ abort( toolkit.DebugBreak ) ]

         You can also find this code after the above link to zEal's
         post.

         **Tip:** if you want to copy-paste the above code or the code
         from the post, then FIRST paste it into a simple text editor
         and copy it from there and THEN paste it into the MT macro.
         This prevents from unintentional copying e.g. linefeeds (0x0A).
         Even better is using np++ in UTF-8 setting (see header here
         above).

         .. rubric:: Where pause goes wrong
            :name: where-pause-goes-wrong

         A couple of useful things to know when you start using
         ``pause()``.

         -  if you use it at the top of your macro to e.g. check the
            values of the passed on arguments like this:

         .. container:: mw-geshi mw-code mw-content-ltr

            .. container:: mtmacro source-mtmacro

               #. .. code-block:: none

                       [tmp = macro.args]

               #. .. code-block:: none

                       [pause("tmp")]

               #. .. code-block:: none

                       [var1 = arg(0)]

               #. .. code-block:: none

                       [var2 = arg(1)]

         then ``arg(0)`` will no longer exist!! The value that
         ``macro.args`` contain changes as soon as ``pause()`` has run
         as it has its own scope and redefines it. Usually this can lead
         to inexplicable errors so beware of this! It is better to use
         it like this:

         .. container:: mw-geshi mw-code mw-content-ltr

            .. container:: mtmacro source-mtmacro

               #. .. code-block:: none

                       [tmp = macro.args]

               #. .. code-block:: none

                       [var1 = arg(0)]

               #. .. code-block:: none

                       [var2 = arg(1)]

               #. .. code-block:: none

                       [pause("tmp")]

         -  ``pause()`` can only handle very simple HTML code, so if you
            want to debug a dynamic form which you have assigned to a
            variable, I would suggest you use a combination of the
            `Show_HTML </rptools/wiki/Show_HTML>`__ method and put a
            ``pause()`` right after that.

         .. rubric:: The log file
            :name: the-log-file

         Going to a slightly more advanced method you can start using
         the log file.

         First off, if MT crashes you can always check the ``log.txt``
         file which is located in your ``.maptool`` directory. Its
         location varies per OS:

         -  For win7 it is ``C:[username]\.maptool``.
         -  For MacOS it's ``/users/[username]/.maptool/`` aka
            ``~/.maptool/``. Be aware that, because this directory's
            name begins with a dot, it's invisible in the Finder. So,
            either you use a utility like Onyx to make the Finder show
            invisible files, either you use the "Go to > Go to
            directoryâ¦" Finder menu and type one of those path.

         You should also find a ``logging.xml`` file in that directory.
         The XML file tells MapTool what to send to the ``log.txt``
         file. Per default MT install, this will only log generated
         errors.

         You can however also replace this file with the one that you
         can find in the MapTool install directory (the one you unzipped
         initially). In the directory ``Misc`` you find a
         ``macros-logging.xml`` file. You can replace the existing XML
         file in your ``.maptool`` directory with that one (don't forget
         to rename it to ``logging.xml``Â !) and it will log ALL macro
         code. If your code crashes or generates weird errors, you can
         check the log file to see where it went wrong.

         **MAC Users**: upto b89 the ``.dmg`` does NOT contain these
         logging XML files. You will need to download the ``.zip`` file
         to get those.

         This can render into a HUGE log file and slows down MT a bit,
         so be careful with it. In my case I have a PC and Laptop, the
         laptop I use for running the games, so no logging, the PC I use
         for coding so logging is always turned on on that PC.

         BUILD 91 AND LATER

         if your using b91 or later, there is a launcherxxxx.jar
         provided. When you run that you will have an advanced tab.
         There you see 'Macro Handling' checkbox. Check that. This will
         automatically replace the logging.xml file for the right one as
         described above. Don't forget to delete the log.txt file first,
         so its cleared.

         if for some reason this does not work under b91 (as is with one
         of my PCs) you need to manually replace the logging.xml as
         described above AND you must start maptool WITHOUT the
         launcher, as the launcher will simple reset the logging.xml.
         Instead run maptool from a .bat file. To do this simply create
         a file called runMaptool.bat and edit it. Place in the .bat the
         line:

         ::

             java -Xmx1024M -Xss4M -jar maptool-1.3.b91.jar run

         Save it and run it.

         .. rubric:: The Console
            :name: the-console

         The console is the real kicker. I found out about this after a
         year or so and since I'm aware of it it has made coding and
         debugging in MT SO MUCH SIMPLER!!

         **On Windows**

         To activate it you need to do 2 things:

         -  first you need to replace the ``logging.xml`` file with the
            ``macro-logging.xml`` (or check 'macro handling' in the
            launcher for b91+) as described here above.
         -  second you need to edit your ``mt.cfg`` file (called
            ``Launch MapTool.sh`` on \*nix based OS's). This file you
            will find in the install directory. The content will look
            like something like this:

         ::

             MAXMEM=1024
             MINMEM=64
             STACKSIZE=4
             JVM=C:\Program Files\Java\jre6\bin\javaw
             PROMPT=true

         depending on your settings and OS. You need to remove only ONE
         letter: the ``w`` from ``javaw``. So it becomes:

         ::

             JVM=[what it reads here differs per OS]java

         Now you will have a console which shows the MT script
         real-time. Combine this with strategically placed ``pause()``'s
         and debugging becomes a breeze. Here's my usual screen layout
         when I'm debugging: |Wolph42 Debugging Screenshot.jpg|

         | 

         **On MacOS**

         You'll find the Console utility in
         ``/applications/Utilities/``. Just launch it before you launch
         MapTool.

         All applications' messages, including MapTool, will appear in
         the "Console messages" part.

         If you want to focus on MapTool's messages you just have to
         open the ``log.txt`` described in the Log File section above
         with the Console app. Just do a right click on the ``log.txt``
         file and choose "Open withâ¦" from the contextual menu, and then
         of course Console. Don't try to open the file from the Console
         app with the "File > Open" menu, as the directory is invisible
         and won't show.

         You've got a convenient search field to filter out the
         messages. Don't forget it.

         **Notes:**

         -  Text and comment is NOT ported to the console. So

         .. container:: mw-geshi mw-code mw-content-ltr

            .. container:: mtmacro source-mtmacro

               #. .. code-block:: none

                       Hello world

               #. .. code-block:: none

                       <!-- this is comment -->

         won't show in the console nor in the log. However:

         .. container:: mw-geshi mw-code mw-content-ltr

            .. container:: mtmacro source-mtmacro

               #. .. code-block:: none

                       [r:'Hello world']

               #. .. code-block:: none

                       [h:'<!-- this is comment -->']

         will show up! Note though the latter is slower than the former
         to execute (which becomes noticeable around 200 to 400 of these
         lines, so not much to worry about).

         -  I personally find it very useful to quickly see at which
            macro I'm looking, so in the header of all my macros I add:

         .. container:: mw-geshi mw-code mw-content-ltr

            .. container:: mtmacro source-mtmacro

               #. .. code-block:: none

                       [h:'<!-- ------------------------------------MACRO NAME ---------------------------------------->']

         and sometimes I also add a:

         .. container:: mw-geshi mw-code mw-content-ltr

            .. container:: mtmacro source-mtmacro

               #. .. code-block:: none

                       [h:'<!-- ------------------------------------/END MACRO NAME ---------------------------------------->']

         at the bottom, e.g. for the ``pause()`` function!

         -  If you're running heavy macros, especially ones with lots of
            loops, then you will notice that the code runs a lot faster
            when the console is minimized. Keep this in mind!
         -  In Windows you can change the console settings. Especially
            for the MT log this is very useful as the default console
            settings are ``width: 80 characters`` and
            ``Height: 300 lines``. This means that lines are likely
            wrapped making them hard to read, and with a history of 300
            lines you won't come far. You can change this by right
            clicking on the top bar of the console, a context menu
            should pop-up with ``properties``. Here you go to the
            ``layout`` tab and you can edit the ``Screen Buffer Size``.
            My settings are ``Width:600`` and ``Height:2000``.
            Fortunately the settings are remembered by Windows so you
            only need to do this once.

         .. rubric:: Broadcast
            :name: broadcast

         `broadcast() </rptools/wiki/broadcast>`__ is a fairly new
         function to MT and is great for debugging purposes. The
         advantage of `broadcast() </rptools/wiki/broadcast>`__ is that
         it ports the result to the chat IMMEDIATELY. Usually all text
         to chat whether it is ``'this text'`` or ``[r:"this text"]``
         will be accumulated until all macros are done and THEN the text
         is ported to the chatbox. So in case of an
         `abort() </rptools/wiki/abort>`__ or
         `assert() </rptools/wiki/assert>`__ or a crash in the code you
         will find either the assertion message, a bug report or nothing
         at all. All the accumulated text is discarded.

         Two useful usages for
         `broadcast() </rptools/wiki/broadcast>`__:

         .. rubric:: Using broadcast to track down a code crash
            :name: using-broadcast-to-track-down-a-code-crash

         Let's say you have an macro of a few 100 lines, you run it
         and... nothing or some vague message like ``doubleÂ : found``.
         If you want to pin point the crash you can simply put
         `broadcast() </rptools/wiki/broadcast>`__ lines between the
         code and see how far it gets. From the output you can deduce
         the location of the crash. Here an example, lets say you have:

         ::

             [a block of code]
             [another block of code]
             [and yet more blocks of code]
             [and finally a last block of code]

         If you want to find out where the code stops:

         ::

             [a block of code]
             [h:broadcast("1")]
             [another block of code]
             [h:broadcast("2")]
             [and yet more blocks of code]
             [h:broadcast("3")]
             [and finally a last block of code]

         If the output to the chat is eg:

         ::

             1
             2

         Then you'll know that the error is somewhere inside
         ``[and yet more blocks of code]``.

         .. rubric:: Using broadcast to track variable development
            :name: using-broadcast-to-track-variable-development

         I usually use ``pause()`` to check my variables. However if
         something goes wrong somewhere in a 500+ loop, you will be
         clicking ``ok`` a lot. In these instances it is much easier to
         add a:

         .. container:: mw-geshi mw-code mw-content-ltr

            .. container:: mtmacro source-mtmacro

               #. .. code-block:: none

                       [broadcast("variable_name: "+variable_name+"another_variable_name: "+another_variable_name)]

         inside the loop. This way the code is not interrupted but you
         will get to see where the loop goes haywire.

         Like with pause() there is also a more advanced debug macro
         created in maptool. This is bot_debugInfo() In principle it
         makes use of the broadcast method but it has a huge set of
         extra options to make more optimally use of this function and
         to easier track down issues. This function is part of the `Bag
         of
         Tricks <http://forums.rptools.net/viewtopic.php?f=46&t=16066>`__.
         Note that pause() is also part of this bag, so if you install
         it you don't need to create it seperately.

         .. rubric:: Bug tracking by elimination
            :name: bug-tracking-by-elimination

         This is a very basic method and also a 'if all else fails'.
         When you've used all the other methods and are still stuck, its
         time to start debugging by elimination. Most common use is in a
         code:{} (or frame:{}, dialog:{}, etc.) block that has a bug
         inside the block but generates an error report on the 'code
         block' level, making the broadcast, pause, console methods
         useless.

         The method is very simple and can take different forms. The
         first is simply deleting large chunks of code and running the
         macro again until you've eliminated the bug. Then you start
         placing code back again and so you can narrow down to the
         line(s) where the code crashes. Usually in a large macro with a
         big code block that crashes, I start with deleting the entire
         body (that is everything between the { } ) to see if the block
         itself works. If that's the case I start putting back lines of
         code until the macro crashes. Its tedious, but VERY effective.

         Another more preferable approach (but not always possible) is
         to remove the code:{} block itself and run the code body with
         the required parameters. So e.g. run this:

         ::

             [foreach(element, elements), CODE:{
               [if(element == 1): bla]
               [bla]
             }]

         as this

         ::

               [element = 1]
               [if(element == 1): bla]
               [bla]

         this way the macro will crash on the specific line which allows
         you to use the console, pause, broadcasts methods again.

         'Note' that in case of dialogs and frames, you can do the same
         thing. The generated HTML will be ported straight to the chat.
         This can however lead to a stack overflow (porting large
         portions of text straight from a macro to the chat will cause
         that), you can omit that by raising the stack to 20
         (TEMPORARILY!, normally you should never go higher then 4
         during a game).

         .. rubric:: Typical Bugs
            :name: typical-bugs

         Here I'll give a few examples of things that typically go wrong
         when coding. It is useful to check this once in a while as a
         reminder and I hope that others will add to this list so this
         accumulates in a FOB (frequently occurring bugs).

         .. rubric:: My number one
            :name: my-number-one

         .. container:: mw-geshi mw-code mw-content-ltr

            .. container:: mtmacro source-mtmacro

               #. .. code-block:: none

                     can't

         or better recognized in

         .. container:: mw-geshi mw-code mw-content-ltr

            .. container:: mtmacro source-mtmacro

               #. .. code-block:: none

                     <!-- this you can't do in MT script -->

         This is not the most occurring bug, but it certainly is the
         most annoying as it REALLY screws up your code and it is hell
         to debug. The issue is with the single quote. When
         strategically placed this can result in an entire section of
         code not being executed, picking it up later or dropping back
         to the parent macro altogether. IF you also close the quote
         (that is put a second one in the comment as well) then there
         will be no issue, also if you encapsulate it in a ``[h:" "]``
         (and not ``[h:'  ']``) it will run along nicely.

         About the latter, although the MT script allows you to stuff
         like this

         ::

             He hits for [r:1d6+strength]

         I find it bad practice (and generally the first step in hard to
         debug code) to NOT follow the sacred 'code' code, which is: 1.
         input 2. process 3. output

         example

         ::

             <!- input -->
             [h:input("strength")]
             <!- process -->
             [h:textOut = "He hits for 1d6 + "+strength+": "+1d6+strength]
             <!- output -->
             [r:textOut]

         .. rubric:: THE number one
            :name: the-number-one

         It remains a guess but I think it is a safe assumption that two
         ``:`` in one line of code (with the exception of switch and
         code) is the most commonly made mistake. Fortunately MT
         generates clear debug info on this one the syntax is ALWAYS:

         ::

            [option , option , optionÂ : function]

         .. rubric:: Stray semicolon ';' in the chat
            :name: stray-semicolon-in-the-chat

         I think this one is in second place, not a bug per se, but
         annoying nonetheless. This occurs when you forget to include
         the *false* part in an ``if`` statement when using the code
         option, e.g.:

         .. container:: mw-geshi mw-code mw-content-ltr

            .. container:: mtmacro source-mtmacro

               #. .. code-block:: none

                       [if(statement), CODE:{apparently the statement is true}]

         will generate the following output:

         ::

             apparently the statement is true
            Â ;

         this is easily prevented by adding ``';{}'``Â :

         .. container:: mw-geshi mw-code mw-content-ltr

            .. container:: mtmacro source-mtmacro

               #. .. code-block:: none

                       [if(statement), CODE:{apparently the statement is true};{}]

         .. rubric:: Stray comma ',' in the chat
            :name: stray-comma-in-the-chat

         Another common 'bug' encountered regularly are stray comma's.
         Obviously there can be numerous reasons for this to happen but
         in most cases it is because of a loop like
         `[foreach():] </rptools/wiki/foreach_(roll_option)>`__ or
         `[for():] </rptools/wiki/for_(roll_option)>`__. This for
         example:

         .. container:: mw-geshi mw-code mw-content-ltr

            .. container:: mtmacro source-mtmacro

               #. .. code-block:: none

                       [foreach(number, "1,2,3,4"), CODE:{[h:"don't show this"]}]

         will generate:

         ::

             ,,,

         For this particular example this is simply solved by hiding the
         output altogether:

         .. container:: mw-geshi mw-code mw-content-ltr

            .. container:: mtmacro source-mtmacro

               #. .. code-block:: none

                       [h,foreach(number, "1,2,3,4"), CODE:{["don't show this"]}]

         Note that when the outer loop is hidden, that the contents are
         hidden by default so the h: is not necessary. If you do wish to
         show the context BUT not the comma's, you need to define the
         delimiter e.g.:

         -  Seperate by nothing:

         .. container:: mw-geshi mw-code mw-content-ltr

            .. container:: mtmacro source-mtmacro

               #. .. code-block:: none

                       [r,foreach(number, "1,2,3,4", ""), CODE:{[r:"Hello World"]}]

         -  Seperate by space:

         .. container:: mw-geshi mw-code mw-content-ltr

            .. container:: mtmacro source-mtmacro

               #. .. code-block:: none

                       [r,foreach(number, "1,2,3,4", " "), CODE:{[r:"Hello World"]}]

         -  Seperate by break:

         .. container:: mw-geshi mw-code mw-content-ltr

            .. container:: mtmacro source-mtmacro

               #. .. code-block:: none

                       [r,foreach(number, "1,2,3,4", "<br>"), CODE:{[r:"Hello World"]}]

         **Tip**: To pin point the origin of a stray comma in a large
         chunk of code, you can put numbers (1,2,3,4,etc) between the
         code. These numbers will appear in the chat and the comma will
         be among them, making it easier to find it.

         .. rubric:: Closing syntax characters
            :name: closing-syntax-characters

         A myriad of errors can be created by not closing off syntax
         characters: ``[ ] ( ) { } " " ' '``

         To help diagnose this, copy your macro into a text editor.
         `aliasmask's Notepad++
         mod <http://forums.rptools.net/viewtopic.php?t=13690%7C>`__ is
         recommended as it has other uses for MapTool. Use the
         ``find/count`` function to count each of the characters, and
         the totals should equal for each pair.

         Note, if you use strings which contain only one of the paired
         syntax characters e.g. ``"1) This is the first point."`` you
         should *close* off the pair in a comment:

         .. container:: mw-geshi mw-code mw-content-ltr

            .. container:: mtmacro source-mtmacro

               #. .. code-block:: none

                       [h: '<!-- This comment is to close off the bracket in the next line ( -->']

               #. .. code-block:: none

                       [h: broadcast ("1) This is the first point.")]

         other issues can arise with stray 'single quotes' in words like
         ``it's, didn't, don't, etc``. If these are not enclosed in " "
         or closed of by another ', you will get bogus output or syntax
         errors.

         .. rubric:: Cheater you have been reported
            :name: cheater-you-have-been-reported

         This *functionality* is embedded to prevent cheatingâ¦
         obviously. However this can also result in this error message
         (and only this error message) in your own code! This typically
         happens when `broadcast() </rptools/wiki/broadcast>`__ the
         result of an `evalMacro() </rptools/wiki/evalMacro>`__ call,
         where the `evalMacro() </rptools/wiki/evalMacro>`__ result
         contains Â«Â guillemotsÂ Â»: . E.g. paste this into your chat:

         .. container:: mw-geshi mw-code mw-content-ltr

            .. container:: mtmacro source-mtmacro

               #. .. code-block:: none

                       [h:result = evalMacro(decode("4 The attack scoops out one of the target's eyes, inflicting <b>[Fat=1d5] level(s) of Fatigue"))]

               #. .. code-block:: none

                       [h:broadcast(result)]

         To debug this I store ``result`` in a
         `lib:token </rptools/wiki/Library_Token>`__ property before I
         do the `broadcast() </rptools/wiki/broadcast>`__. From the text
         it is usually easy to find where the guillemots have entered.
         So:

         .. container:: mw-geshi mw-code mw-content-ltr

            .. container:: mtmacro source-mtmacro

               #. .. code-block:: none

                       [h:result = evalMacro(decode("4 The attack scoops out one of the target's eyes, inflicting <b>[Fat=1d5] level(s) of Fatigue"))]

               #. .. code-block:: none

                       [h:setLibProperty("debugOutput", result, "lib:Token")]

               #. .. code-block:: none

                       [h:broadcast(result)]

         Then after running the macro I can copy paste that property
         inside a text editor and track down the guillemots.

         .. rubric:: The Switch Case
            :name: the-switch-case

         Another really annoying little bug. If you ever get stuck with
         the use of `[switch():] </rptools/wiki/switch_(roll_option)>`__
         cause it keeps generating error reports and you REALLY can't
         find the issue, then likely you have used ``Case`` or ``CASE``
         or any other variant with a capital letter in it. As it happens
         ``case`` is case-sensitive (yes it almost looks
         intentional...). Anyway
         `[switch():] </rptools/wiki/switch_(roll_option)>`__ ONLY works
         with ``case`` (so lower case only!).
