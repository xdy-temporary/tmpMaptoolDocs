         I note that the features do not link to any articles going into
         depth about those features. Assuming that is conventional to
         keep this page as a showcase/marketing style page rather than a
         help document, I'm following this convention with my edits. If
         this is not intentional, or others see value in peppering links
         to expanded articles within the feature list, please make the
         case. --`Melek </rptools/wiki/User:Melek>`__
