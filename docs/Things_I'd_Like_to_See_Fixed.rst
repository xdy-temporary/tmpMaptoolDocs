         The list below was made by me personally (Azhrei) as a reminder
         of things I wanted to work on. It is not given in any
         particular order, although I did rank things I thought were
         more important with plus signs ("+") and less important with
         minus signs ("-"). Anyone wishing to contribute code to MapTool
         in the form of Java patches should post to the Developer Notes
         forum and specify which items you want to tackle as we may have
         guidelines on how we want to see the item implemented.

         .. rubric:: List of bug fix items for MapTool 1.3
            :name: list-of-bug-fix-items-for-maptool-1.3

         There are other things beyond this list that would be "nice to
         have" but since 1.3 is in feature freeze, they won't be
         happening.

         #. Loading campaign doesn't draw the screen correctly on the
            first refresh of the map
         #. Error in Help docs for the Campaign Properties > Light tab.
            http://forums.rptools.net/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=19240&view=unread#p203192
         #. Moving seems to clear fog for all players, while Meta-I only
            clears for the selected token(s).
         #. Add build.xml target for clearing the version.txt to get
            back to DEVELOPMENT
         #. Add Help menu option that displays Java SystemProperties for
            debugging purposes (Java version, user.dir, other
            information from SysInfo?)
         #. Add startup check that grabs notes from rptools.net for
            display to user (used for things like version notes, update
            notes, etc)
         #. Feedback on SVN 5769 (latest as of 7/3)
            http://forums.rptools.net/viewtopic.php?f=60&t=19195
         #. Variable transparency for the statsheet?
         #. Dropping first token doesn't use Preferences setting for
            Filename vs. Creature name?

         #. Movement metrics need to be displayed above hard fog
         #. If statsheet is being displayed, map rendering should be
            clipped out of that area
         #. Right-click menu on tokens sometimes is above or under the
            statsheet
         #. When I draw VBL with the Poly Line tool and try to start a
            new line where the last line ended, it wonâ€™t work. I have to
            literally draw the line somewhere else and then go back to
            that point.
         #. Using the # in campaign properties should imply the \*, but
            without the \* actually showing up in the list
