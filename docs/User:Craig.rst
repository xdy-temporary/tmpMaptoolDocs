         This page is really boring, but you might be interested in the
         `mozilla
         ubiquity <http://labs.mozilla.com/2008/08/introducing-ubiquity/>`__
         script I created to support my general laziness.

         You can find the script `here <http://gist.github.com/94275>`__

         It offers the following commands

         ``rptwiki`` *topic*

         ::

               Provides a preview of the topic in the wiki and can open it in a new tab.

         ``rptwiki-link-bb`` *topic*

         ::

               Creates a bbcode url to the topic so you can easily post it to the rtpools forums.

         It now also has the following commands thanks to Verisimilar.

         | 
         | ``rptwiki-func`` *function*

         ::

               Creates a bbcode url to the function so you can easily post it to the rtpools forums.

         ``rptwiki-roll`` *roll*

         ::

               Creates a bbcode url to the roll so you can easily post it to the rtpools forums.

         As usual you should look at the code to make sure I am not
         doing anything you don't want me to do on your machine before
         installing.
