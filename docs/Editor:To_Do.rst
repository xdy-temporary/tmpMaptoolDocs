         If you see something that needs to be done, but don't have the
         time, inclination, or knowledge to do it at the time, please
         add one of the following templates to this article so it
         doesn't get forgotten.

         -  `Template:Clarify </rptools/wiki/Template:Clarify>`__
         -  `Template:stub </rptools/wiki/Template:stub>`__

         Use the templates' parameters to detail changes to be done, and
         if it doesn't seem enough, the talk page associated with the
         marked article to discuss any implementation details you might
         want to flesh out first.
